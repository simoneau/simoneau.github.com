I think they are a match made in heaven. Regardless of what anyone one thinks about Dita, she obviously has the same aesthetics and interests as Marilyn and has captured his heart. I love how she's brought burlesque back and got noticed for her stunning, vintage, look. It's about time!!!I am so sick of the media shoving Mary-Kate, JLo, Jennifer Anniston, Paris Hilton, etc. in our faces!!! Who wants to see those orange, frosty hair broads over and over again?! As for Manson, quite frankly, I find him unattractve, but who cares? They are beautiful in each others eyes! 
She is not riding his coat tails either. She has been at her career for a long time and doing her own thing.
May they have a lifelong union!
