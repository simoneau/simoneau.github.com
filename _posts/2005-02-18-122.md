Directions from my house to San Francisco: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=from%20Boston%2C%20MA%2002118%20to%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20CA">go to Salt Lake City and take a left</a> (42 instructions).

Directions from my house to Los Angeles: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=from%20Boston%2C%20MA%2002118%20to%20San%20Francisco%2C%20CA">go just keep going west</a> (38 instructions).

Click on the map and drag it around (or use your arrow keys).  Use the zoom slider (or use the "+" and "-" keys).  Make your window bigger and smaller.  This feels like a desktop application.  Google has long kept their interface nice and simple.  Starting with <a href="http://gmail.com">Gmail</a>, then with <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1">Google Suggest</a>, and now with <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, Google has shown that it can also offer a rich user interface over the web.  Using Javascript, a page can phone home for more data on-the-fly without forcing a page reload.  It can also listen for keystrokes and window resizing.  All this while preserving the page's usability, including the its clean design and bookmark-ability.

It's no wonder my Google stock has doubled.
