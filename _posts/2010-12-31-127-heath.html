<p>I'm a little obsessed with this building. It is another old brewery, just up Heath Street from the converted brewery I live in. The building is beautiful, but in tough shape. I fantasize about buying it and turning it into a work/play/live space for myself and my friends.</p>

<p>A little googling turned up some interesting information. This is the <a href="http://www.jphs.org/victorian/bostons-lost-breweries.html">John R. Alley brewery, built in 1886</a>. There's still a <a href="http://www.weezah.com/hampden_contact.htm">Hampden auto parts</a> sign on it, but it is now <a href="http://hubmaps1.cityofboston.gov/egis/Map.aspx?PropertyID=1001281000">owned by Mayo Group</a> and assessed at $841,000. Mayo Group went through the approval process to convert the building to lofts, <a href="http://www.mayogroup.com/developments_property.aspx?id=25">but is now offering the property and plans up for sale</a>, likely stalled by the real estate crash.</p>
<p>The future of the building is uncertain. It was recently <a href="http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/jamaica_plain/2010/09/eight_vacant_jamaica_plain_bui.html">flagged by the city as a problem property</a>, citing windows open to the elements, falling brick, and other issues. Its neglect and <a href="http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/jamaica_plain/2010/11/history_time_bostons_beer-maki.html">history in manufacturing</a> probably would make it tough to convert it to living space. I certainly don't have the money or the skills to take on a project like this. Still, I continue to think about it.</p>
