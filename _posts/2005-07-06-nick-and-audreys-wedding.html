<p>Julie invited me to the wedding of one of her former coworkers.  It was the first Jewish wedding I've attended.  It wasn't that different from other weddings I've attended, but they do have some better props.  I especially liked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuppah">chuppah</a>, a little tent held up over the ceremony by the four parents.  Some quick googling reveals that it isn't always done this way, but to me it represents the past and future support that the parents give to the new couple.</p>
<p>At the reception we sat next to Michelle and her friend Mike.  Michelle is a <a href="http://www.michellelewismusic.com/">folk singer</a>.</p>
