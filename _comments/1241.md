the natural history museum was pretty good and walking along lake michigan is very pleasant. kind of eerie how ocean-like it is but without the smell. 
the "golden mile" is very much like 5th avenue NYC only cleaner. 
The Mashed Potato Club was a fun sort of place, had an assortment of tasty martinis as well as mashed potatoes (yeah aint that stretch?) dont know if its still there, i went with chris several years ago. also we went to this brazilian restaurant i think it was called Rhumba Cafe. big line to get in but the food was good and the mojitos will knock your socks off.
