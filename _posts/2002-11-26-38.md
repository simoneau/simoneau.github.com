<a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1217.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1217.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>On Saturday night, I went to a multi-birthday party.  For the first part of the night, Nick's girlfriend Julia organized a scavenger hunt that lead us all over the city.  Afterwards, we all met back at the Independent for drinks.  We all got pretty toasted.  My digital camera was circulating and produced in some great shots.  You can <a href="/albums/hunt/">view the (mostly) unedited collection</a>.  I particularly like this one of Claire and me acting conspiratorial.  Golly, my ears are red.  Claire, do you remember what I was saying to you at the time?  We look so serious.  If you were there, share your thoughts on the evening using the "comments" link below.
