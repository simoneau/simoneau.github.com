I accidentally discovered that Google Mail is insensitive to the dot.  So:

Firstname.Lastname@gmail.com
FirstnameLastname@gmail.com
F.i.r.s.t.n.a.m.e.L.a.s.t.n.a.m.e@gmail.com 

all go to the same place.

Smart.  I didn't try it with underscores; that's left as an assignment to the reader.  It solves one of the more irritating issue with guessing email addresses, or even in reading them and properly typing them afterward (people often don't notice the period).  

Along a similar vein, if you dial 811 that rings 911 in many areas.
