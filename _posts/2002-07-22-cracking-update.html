<p>Here's what my web hosting provider had to say:</p>
<p><i>Thank you for informing us of this.  It happens all of the time where spammers and hackers spider sites looking for an exploitable version of formmail to send out SPAM.  As long as you have the newest version of formmail.pl from Matts Script Archive or none at all, you should be good to go.</i></p>
