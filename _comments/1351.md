Dita is a very sexually attractive woman, to suggest that she looks like a man is rather ludicrous. The woman has a great body and an attractive face, for those who feel otherwise that is fine, to each their own. But it is apparent to me that many of you who have stated that she is masculine in appearance do not understand what sex appeal or magentism is -it is in your face, it riles you up in a good way and for some negatively, it knocks you off your feet with no real choice in the matter, it makes people who desire you, want you, want to get to know more about you and they may not know why, and it makes those who are insecure and envious all the more so!!!!
