I moved my blogging platform from self-hosted <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> to <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>-hosted <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I don't recommend this move to anyone who is not a programmer, but I've already gotten a lot of satisfaction out of making my chages as <a href="https://github.com/simoneau/simoneau.github.com/commits/master">commits</a> (with all the benefits of revision control) instead of opaque updates to a database.
