We had a wonderful family vacation at Grout Pond. We're not very experienced campers or backpackers, and the hike to the camp site was only about 15 minutes from the parking lot and beach. Our spot was totally secluded in the forest and right on the edge of the lake. It was gorgeous at all times of the day and night, and dead silent except for the drunken party that went on in camp site #1 on Friday night, August 27, 2010. The party echoed back and forth across the water until 3 in the morning. The next day they hung two US flags for all to see, as if to say it was OK for them to disturb everyone because they're so patriotic. People like this are a disgrace to everything our country stands for, and they defile our beautiful national treasures. Unfortunately, they are the way the rest of the world has come to see us: aggressive, dominant and out of control. In all fairness, everyone else at Grout Pond was decent, friendly,  and respectful of their surroundings. Green Mountain National Forest inspires a reverence for nature and American history. I would definitely go again, but only on weeknights!
