Amazon remembers every order you ever placed.  My first order was on March 3, 2000.  Here's what it contained:

<ul>
<li>Red Mars, by Kim Stanley Robinson</li>
<li>The Hedgehog and the Fox : An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History, by Isaiah Berlin</li>
<li>Cocktail : The Drinks Bible for the 21st Century, by Paul Harrington, Laura Moorhead</li>
</ul>

I liked Red Mars, but never got around to reading the rest of the books in the series.  The Hedgehog and the Fox was good too.  I was reminded of this book recently in an excellent <a href="http://www.longnow.org/projects/seminars/">SALT</a> podcast by Philip Tetlock called &quot;Why Foxes Are Better Forecasters Than Hedgehogs&quot;.  The real winner in this batch is Cocktail, which I still reference regularly.  This is no surprise though.  I was already familiar with this same material from HotWired's <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990222063457/www.hotwired.com/cocktail/">Cocktail</a>, which introduced me in 96-97 to what are still my three favorite drinks, the Gibson, the Rusty Nail, and the Sidecar.

Viewing the payment info and it said I used a gift certificate for that order.  I searched my e-mail and found the original gift certificate.  It was a gift from Diana, the same Diana I would start dating later that year.

Embarrassingly, the search also turned up the fact that this gift certificate originally expired before I cashed it in.  Amazon was nice enough to send me this e-mail a month later:

<blockquote>We've discovered that you received a $&lt;INSERT_AMOUNT_HERE&gt; Amazon.com gift certificate, and that it expired without ever being redeemed.  That's no fun. So, as our gift to you, we're reactivating it.</blockquote>

In spite of the honkey-tonk mail merge that left in <i>INSERT_AMOUNT_HERE</i>, I was able to reactivate it and make my first purchase.
