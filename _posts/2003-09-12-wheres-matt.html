<p>Outside each of our offices is a whiteboard.  Many months ago, <a href="http://www.snowboardgirl.net/">Kristin</a> drew this picture on mine.  Apparently, she was looking for me.  This isn't surprising, since she gets into the office an hour or two before I do.  The "MMM BBQ!!!!" was added later.  It was time to erase her work, but I've preserved it here.</p>
