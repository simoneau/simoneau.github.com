I must agree with Carric, my replay 5040 is the biggest hunk of junk ever. I bought it to replace a Tivo that was so old it only held 14 hours of shows. I read some reviews decided to try the Replay big mistake! First unit was dead in a month hard drive locking up blocky picture had to pull the plug 3 times a day to restart it. Went through the same crap with the tech support who are in INDIA, I asked. Finally they had me ship it back at my expense. They sent a new unit it arrived DOA they must have never even tested it when it left refurb. I called India 12 times in one day got disconnected all 12 times because they where having phone difficulties, they promised to call back, so far they have not. They keep wanting to trouble shoot it, the RCA jacks came so screwed up you can't get the connector over 1 how can you fix that over the phone??? I'm sure they will want me to pay shipping again even though I called the day it arrived. I'm just going to toss it and get another Tivo. The picture was better, it changed channels faster, the interface was more user friendly and it WORKED. Dont buy a Replay, with this kind of service they will be sure to go under soon.
