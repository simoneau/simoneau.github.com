I just found out today that Jay had passed away.  I have known Jay for several years.  We met in Detroit and then again in Toronto a few weeks later.  I invited him home to have dinner with my family at Easter.  He never got another word in after they arrived.  I cannot believe that he has left this world.  I have been trying to reach him for several months, starting back in July as were were scheduled to meet up in Montreal for thier Pride festivities.  Today I finally contacted his friend Greg in MN and found out the bad news ;(
Jay, you will be missed deeply and profoundly.
Love always, John
