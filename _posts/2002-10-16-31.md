<a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1076.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1076.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>Our cafeteria has a decent salad bar.  It offers the choice between two bins of lettuce.  One is strictly iceberg and the other is a mixture of more-exotic kinds.  I'm usually fill up on the latter and am generally pleased with the mix.  There is one green, however, that I don't understand at all (see picture).  It has a faint bitter taste and the texture of a young shrub.  What is this?  Is this some sort of weed?  Does anybody actually like this?  I eat around these and a little pile is left at the end of my lunch.
