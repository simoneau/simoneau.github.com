Love the scissorhands, dude.  Was gonna go as ed, but gf talked me into Vincent Vega to her Mia Wallace.  I think I'll party as Vincent tonight, but go as ed on halloween.  I want to be totally leathered out Edward, though.  My gf can do my hair, and I can make some hands like you did.  Great craftmanship on the scissorhands.  I wonder if they make chrome tape.
