Julie and I spent a weekend at <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/gmfl/green_mountain/recreation_management/camping/groutpondcamping.htm">Grout Pond</a> in the Green Mountain National Forest.  It was a bit muddy, but we nearly had the place to ourselves and the bugs weren't yet in full force.  Check out the view of the pond from campsite #9.
