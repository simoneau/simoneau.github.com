Matthew, I found this on Google. I'm president of the Shelburne Falls Area Business Association, and I'm glad you had a good visit to our town. But since this page is coming up on a search, I need to inform you and your readers that the town of Shelburne closed access to the Glacial Potholes until further notice because of an escalation in the number and severity of injuries -- it's not a safe place to swim. 

However, this fascinating and beautiful area can still be enjoyed from the observation deck. Come back and visit soon!
