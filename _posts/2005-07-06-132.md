Karen is now the pastry chef at Great Bay.  Karl organized a group of us to go out and sample her new creations.  She sent us out a great mixed plate for dessert, which we devoured (see the before and after pictures).  Also, my parents will be happy to hear that this expensive restaurant in Boston provides the same individual-sized mini salt and pepper shakers that they use at home (see photo).
