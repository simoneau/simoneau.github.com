I am the TeenWolf in the picture - just found this site.  Wish I had found it long ago, and I would have helped out with everyone's requests.

For the jersey, I bought a blank t-shirt (made of jersey material) and cut off the arms and neck to make a jersey.  I used iron-on tape to make the letters numbers and trim.  I luckily found a pair of shorts on eBay that matched the jersey.  

For the arms and legs, I actually bought a few yards of fake fur and sewed the suit together.  It even goes under the jersey for realism.

For the make-up, I bought a $5 "werewolf" make-up kit at the Halloween store, then bought crepe theatrical hair and glued it on my forehead combing it back under the headband, and applied it as a beard pretty much as well (after applying the make-up).  Be sure to get the remover when you buy the spirit gum.  It will come in handy.
