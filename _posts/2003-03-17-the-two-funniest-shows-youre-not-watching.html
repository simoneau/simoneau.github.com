<p>Searching for another South Park, Comedy Central has been experimenting with all kinds of off-beat formats in its original programming.  They've hit on two winners.  Both are odd twists on "reality TV".  Fundamentally improvisational, they're downright hilarious when they hit their groove.</p>
<p><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/insomniac.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" />Each episode of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/insomniac/">Insomniac with Dave Attell</a> opens with Dave doing stand-up in wherever city his tour has taken him.  Leaving the club, he hits the town, staying up all night and exploring the city.  In Boston, for example, he went to a frat party, relaxed in a steam bath, talked to the fruitcakes in Harvard Square, drank the freedom trail, visited a sewerage treatment plant, and watched the sun come up from a boat on the Charles.  All the time, Dave drinks and smokes and pokes fun of everyone he meets.</p>
<p><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/crankyankers.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /><a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/tv_shows/crankyankers/">Crank Yankers</a> is even stranger.  Famous comedians make crank calls.  They usually see how far they can string along some customer service type in with an absurd situation.  For example, Sarah Silverman calls a salon to complain that her last bikini wax, though beautifully done, gave her crabs.  The real twist however, is that they act out both ends of the conversation with Muppet-like puppets.</p>
<p>Good stuff.  Check it out.</p>
