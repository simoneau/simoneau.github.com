<i>And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</i> Revelation 12:9

To help bridge our differences, I invited both angels and demons to a mixer at my house.  Here are some scattered photos from the night.
