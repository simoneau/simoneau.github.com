<p><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/strongbad.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /><a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com">Homestar Runner</a> is a tough-to-navigate site full of short Flash animations starring an odd collection of characters.  It's a labor of love by two brothers, <a href="http://www.legionstudios.com/interviews/views/homestar/homestar.html">Matt and Mike Chapman</a>.  Over the past few years, they've developed a distinctive style influenced by 80s pop culture, a taste for the wholesome yet strange, and their own subtle humor.</p>
<p>One section on their site has become something of a break-out hit.  (My cousin says it has really caught on at the high school where she teaches.)  Nearly every week, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html">Strong Bad answers an e-mail</a> from one of his fans.  My first exposure to this site was a coworker showing me <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html">trogdor</a>, one of these.  I didn't really get it at first, but I was curious enough to check out a few more.  After watching a dozen or so, I was hooked.  Much of the humor is character driven and self referential, so be sure to give it a chance.  Warm up with <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail38.html">helium</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail49.html">frat party</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail61.html">monster truck</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail53.html">comic</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail17.html">girlfriend studying</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail57.html">japanese</a>, and <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail65.html">unused e-mail</a>.  Then finish up with my favorites: <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail45.html">techno</a> and <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail20.html">spring cleaning</a>.</p>
<p>If you like Strong Bad's e-mail, seek out the other goodies on the site, including <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/whatsinthebag.html">Lookin' at a Thing in a Bag</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/fhqwhgads.html">Everybody to the Limit</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/whereis.html">Where is the Cheat?</a>, <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/answer6.html">Marzipan's Answering Machine</a>, and <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/homestarloween.html">Homestarloween Party</a>.  If you got this far, go and <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/homestarrunner/tshirts1.html">buy a T-shirt</a>.  Because they don't clutter up their site with banner ads, it's their only source of revenue.</p>
