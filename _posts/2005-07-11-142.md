My company returned to the <a href="http://www.mtwashington.com/" rel="nofollow">Mount Washington Hotel</a> for its annual summer outing.  We’ve had about half of these at Mount Washington since I’ve been with the company, and returning there  always make me remember my first outing in 1997, fresh out of college.

It’s amazing how fast time moves.  Tracy gave me my digital camera for Christmas 2001 (it’s now a dinosaur) and I started posting pictures here shortly after.  I’ve accumulated quite an archive of company events.  For summer outings alone, I have pictures from <a href="http://www.matthewsim.com/weblog/149/" rel="nofollow">Mt. Snow Resort in 2002</a> and <a href="http://www.matthewsim.com/weblog/143/" rel="nofollow">Mt. Washington Hotel in 2003</a>.  There was no 2004 summer outing because <a href="http://www.matthewsim.com/weblog/104/" rel="nofollow">we went to Disney World</a> instead.
