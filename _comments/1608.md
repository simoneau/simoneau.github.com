Special thanks to Zach for getting us at the party.  I'm sure the expression on his face in the original picture is "Ya Sure, I spend months slaving over Titanic shadows rendering and making coffee for Cameron, smuggle my friends into this wrap party, engineer an encounter with the lovely Linda Hamilton and you guys take alpha position away from me!".

In the picture left-to-right:  Matt, Linda, Peter, Zach. River in background.  JT snapping the shutter.

Never understimate the power of the Christmas Miracle.
