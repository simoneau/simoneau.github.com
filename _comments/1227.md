Very funny is that I was experimenting at home with SMTP and relaying and left my server wide open.   A couple days later, I'm trying to surf the latest NASCAR news and my connection is dead. I look at the modem and it is going crazy!  Someone found my mail server with its open relay and was sending thousands of XXX emails!  My little linux box did its best,  but the maillog got full of "undeliverable mail" messages.  I had to reboot.

anything can happen on the net.
