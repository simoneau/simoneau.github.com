I use the Kyocera 6035 on a Verizon network (same phone number, seven years, same problem) and have had no problem with it, other than the fact that the phone is honking enormous.  I'm looking forward to the Kyocera 7145 eagerly, since it actually clamshells up.

Now, if only Sony would make a Clie phone, with that lovely high-resolution screen and all...

*sigh*
