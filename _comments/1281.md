It's easy if you can find away to get their computer's "name" without them knowing.  You can find it by going to Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Sytem&gt;Computer Name Tab (on their comp, of course).
Don't try to send to what is in the text box, you must send it to what is in the 'Full Computer Name' field.
Then just run a NET SEND computername Hi Bob! Guess Who!
