Hello ... I knew Jay when he lived in Ann Arbor. We completely lost touch when he moved to Boston, but were still great friends up till then. I still drive past his street and smile at the house he bought here, after moving out of the rental that was slated to be torn down for development. At one time I was to have taken over the third floor and do "whatever I wanted" to make it livable.  
I talked to him on the phone at MW in Boston, when he first started working there. He told me it was time for cookies: someone in the office had a Mom who baked cookies and brought them in on Fridays, so the conversation was short. That was the last time I spoke with him. 
Its Good Friday, 2008. Not sure what led me to look him up on google today, but finding this article puts to rest some questions as to not hearing from him for such a long time. I'm also stunned. If you still see these, would you please contact me and let me know what happened. 
Many thanks
Mike mwm822@hotmail.com
