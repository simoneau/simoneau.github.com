hello,

You don't know me.  I was surfing for images of "Teen Wolf" of all things.  It began with a search for the soundtrack after I couldn't lift a song from Kazaa.  I found an image of teen wolf partying.  I thought it was bitchin'.  It was a costume party from three years or more ago on your site.  So, I was like... who in the name of God are these people with such elaborate halloween costumes?  Flipped through your site a bit.  Thought it was cool.  Figured I'd post to let you know that a complete stranger had looked through your site.  So now I know what it's like to be young, living in Boston, and all that.  Hello from the dirty south!  You should write a memoir or something... then again, i suppose that's what this is?  People in the sticks often wonder what it's like to live in the city.  Looks like a situation comedy in the making...  maybe call it "drunk friends".  I don't know?

JWB
