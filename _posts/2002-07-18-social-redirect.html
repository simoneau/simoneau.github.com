<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0640.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0640.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>We all know of Amsterdam's policies of legalized prostitution and soft drug use.  They take a socially objectionable activity and nudge it in a direction that makes it less so.  Less well know is that they've applied this attitude to men's propensity for pissing on the street.  They've scattered bare-bones outdoor urinals in the busy parts of town.  I used one of these when I was there a couple weeks ago.  They are not for the modest.  It made me feel a little strange to be holding what I was holding, while watching the foot traffic go right by me.</p>
