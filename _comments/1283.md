matt, i will say that your camera recovery is yet another sign that the s$%t just dont stick. 

amazing. 

and the caption for the startled nate and jeni picture should be "do you know what they do with their dead?! they BURN THEM!!" 

10 geek points goes to whomever remembers the source of that reference. 

that picture of karin and i...somewhere i think i have other much older but similar pictures of the 2 of us together grinning like monkeys that just set the house on fire. some things never change. 

also nate wins the "surprisingly most drunk" award. matt ties with brian heleen for the "least surprising most drunk". pete, im sorry but you werent even close.

and next time somebody please remind me that i should wear higher necklines... 

have you got more pics matt or were those it?
