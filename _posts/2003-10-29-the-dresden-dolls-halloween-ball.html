<p>Steve, Stuart, and I went to the Dresden Dolls' Halloween Ball as a Krusty Burger employee, Edward Scissorhands, and William Wallace.<br />

<p>There were two ways you could get tickets.  You could either win them from WBCN, or get them directly from the band.  The band sent out an e-mail to their fan list that anyone who sent a spooky hand-made picture of the band would earn a spot on their guest list.  I've no drawing ability, so I commissioned a work from an artist drawing portraits at the UMass Amherst Campus Center concourse.  I was out at UMass to promote my company at a career fair, saw the artist, explained the situation, and he agreed to do it.  I think it came out great.</p>

<p>They hung all the entries up on the walls in the balcony.</p>

<p>This is Stuart's entry.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3685.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3685.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>They even hung up his letter.</p>

<p>Stuart's costume was very impressive.  </p>

<p>The scissor-hands were also a constant source of entertainment.</p>
<p>He cuts my hair:</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3693.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3693.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>He cuts off Ted Williams' head:</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3709.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3709.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>He eats some food:</p>

<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3714.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3714.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>He duels with Freddy Krueger:</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3710.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3710.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>He tries to drink:</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3697.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3697.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Thinking ahead, he brought a straw:</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3702.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3702.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>The costume was also a big hit with the ladies.  They think of how nice Edward was, and then the think of Johnny Depp.  These are both good things.</p>

<p>Karl turned me on to the Dresden Dolls a while ago.  He and Kathy dressed as a priest and a boy scout respectively.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3706.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3706.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>They were edged out of first place in the pair-costume contest by another crowd favorite, the Ambiguously Gay Duo.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3728.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3728.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>This was the best costume party I'd ever been to.  There were a lot of professional-looking costumes.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3704.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3704.JPG" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3711.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3711.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Look at the massive horse body this centaur was dragging around.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3732.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3732.JPG" /></a></p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3734.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3734.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Two costumes types that can't miss are 80s nostalgia (Teen Wolf) and sexy-anything (sexy-Bo Peep).</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3731.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3731.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Speaking of sexy, this police woman was whipping the other one.  They were both wearing vinyl.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3736.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3736.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Being topical is always good, too.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3707.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3707.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Here's a crowd shot.  Notice the gigantic Abominable Snowman in the upper-right corner.  I like this costume mostly because it had a crushed Herbie the Elf stuck to his back.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3716.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3716.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>When I saw his head lying around, I couldn't resist taking a picture of us.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3740.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3740.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>Here's another pair costume.  I'll give you a hint.  There should be a string going from underneath her skirt and attaching to his head.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3724.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3724.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>There were also some living statues scattered around.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3701.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3701.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>It was a very friendly crowd.  Thse are a couple of the people I talked with for a while.</p>

<p>Warm up band wasn't very good, but I guess that's par for the course.</p>
<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3719.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3719.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>The Dresden Dolls put on a great show.  They describe their music as "Brechtian Punk Cabaret".  Buried in their difficult-to-navigate <a href="http://www.dresdendolls.com/">website</a> are MP3s of two of their biggest hits, <a href="http://www.dresdendolls.com/downloads_n_lyrics/mp3/the_dresden_dolls_girl_anachronism.mp3">girl anachronism</a> and <a href="http://www.dresdendolls.com/downloads_n_lyrics/mp3/the_dresden_dolls_coin_operated_boy.mp3">coin-operated boy (live version)</a>.</p>

<p>The band finished up around 1AM, but we still had some energy, so we went over to the DeLux for a nightcap.  I had a Scotch, of course.</p>

<p><a href="/albums/dresden/DCP_3752.JPG"><img src="/albums/dresden/thumbnails/DCP_3752.JPG" /></a></p>
<p>This woman stoped us in the parking garage.  She wanted a picture of herself and Edward Scissorhands because she said her son was scared of him.  Here you go.</p>

<p>Steve took these on the way to the DeLux.</p>

<p>Here we are at the DeLux.</p>

<p>I love Halloween.</p>
