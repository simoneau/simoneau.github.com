You did a great job on it. I came across the site while looking for close up pictures of othe people's Edward costumes. I'm going as Edward Scissorhands this year but I'm opting for the leather strappy suit instead of the shirt and suspenders. It's gonna be a challenge to make, but hopefully I can pull it off.

Again, great job on the look. A lot of the ones I've stumbled across are pretty bad. Yours wins hands down.

One question - what'd you use for the scissorhands?
