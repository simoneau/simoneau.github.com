Grout Pond is one of the greatest places to go camping.  Campsite 7 is probably one of the best sites to get because of the location on the water and the size.  For a free campsite, it can't be beat.  You have almost total seclusion from everything.  It does get a wee bit muddy at certain times of the year, but the upkeep they are doing should make it more managable.  The greatest part is you are close enough to Bromley Mountain to spend a day doing alpine slides, deval carts, water slides, mini golf, etc...and if you time your stay right, you could enjoy the local fair and feast on excellent food and buy some inexpensive stuff at all the cool street vendors.  This is my seventh year going and I would suggest it to anyone looking to get away for a few days...or more.
