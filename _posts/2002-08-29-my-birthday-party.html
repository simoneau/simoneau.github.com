<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0983.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0983.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>Thank you everyone for coming out for my birthday party last night.  Surprising me a week ahead of the date, September 4th, was very tricky. It's been many years since I've had a birthday party (outside of my immediate family).  I'd especially like to thank Tracy for putting it all together, and <a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0985.JPG">Tracy and Jay</a> for their heroic last-minute efforts.  Feel better soon, Karen.</p>
