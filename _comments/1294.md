I just got mine yesterday.  Has anyone else noticed that their picture quality has diminished?
  
I love the idea of FF, REW, Pause ...etc.  But my picture sucks!  I have an older projection big screen.  It looked great running directly from my dig cable box.  Now it looks like I am watching everything on tape!!

Please let me know if you have had the same trouble.
