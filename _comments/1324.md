I would like to say that Dita is  unique she is one of a kind and will go down in history.I was lucky enough to see her show in Santa Ana Calif. at the Galaxy theatre.I sat right in front on the stage and she lite it up with her beauty and poise.And i think there are alot of people who are just very jealous of her.Not to many people can go after what the love makeing her art her career.I bought the pinups film from andrew blake and shes so cool.Not to many women can look that good in a sute.What i want to know is if anyone knows where i can get a strap on like the one she wore!!!   LOL xxoox I Love You Dita
