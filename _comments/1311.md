oh my god,did dita really have blonde hair?im 16 and dita has been my idol ever since i discovered her!at my school end of term non-uniform day,i went in as dita-it was really funny seeing the teachers faces!!i would do anything to meet dita,she is simply stunning,i was really flattered when i dressed up as her,coz all my friends guessed instantly who i was,and said i looked just like her!i dont think there is anyone who's beauty measures to hers though.im really gushing now,but i think she is amazing and i adore her!!!
