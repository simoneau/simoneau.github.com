<p>My friend Karen <a href="/weblog/archives/000095.html">left us</a> back in December to become a full-time baker.  She quickly found a job making pastries at Troquet, a fancy French restaurant in Boston.  To support her additional catering and teaching business, she's rented commercial baking space and has just launched <a href="http://www.toutbeurre.com/">Tout Beurre</a> online.  Such great progress!</p>
