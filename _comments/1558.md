While several people have claimed their dismay at the review of Grout Pond, a few things should be pointed out. First off, my wife and I have been camping there since the early 90's and THIS review was posted in 2005. A lot of things have changed in the last few years.

Rivers of mud? Well that didn't start happening until about a billion mountains bikers started using the trails all the time. Then the 4wheelers started. About half the campsites are now closed due to flooding/erousion. Most of the trails are completely torn up. It is a simple fact that if in summer you allow mountain bikers/4wheelers to use the trails, and in winter, snowmobilers, then you are going to end up with torn up hiking trails. Not that they shouldn't be able to enjoy the area, but some of the hike in trails should have been kept to foot traffic only.

But in 2005, the place was still beautiful, and early in the season, it was pretty quiet. After the middle of May, it starts to get packed. Hugely different from what it was.

Pretty sad all in all, because watching it go downhill year after year, running into more and more rude people from NY/CT/MA has taken it's toll. Not the place it once was.
