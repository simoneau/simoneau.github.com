- Any camping area with little to no bugs, low on offensive scents, and clean are in my eyes a pristine area to camp in.  Glad you guys lucked out on that.  
- I'm real big on having a family camping outing within a shout of other people for safety's sake, but when I go with my husband, I would definitely be interested in sites such as Campsite 7 that Justin commented on.
- Nothing wrong with taking a bit of a hike from your car to a specific campsite as long as you have what you need (including a dual power (ac/dc) heating appliance with a trusty generator to make things nice and cozy.
