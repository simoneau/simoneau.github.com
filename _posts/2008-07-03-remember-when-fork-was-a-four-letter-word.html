<p>It used to be that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)">forking the code</a> was interpreted as a failure in leadership.  Forking would split the code, community, and users into competing factions and generally make life more confusing for everyone (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEmacs#XEmacs_and_GNU_Emacs">XEmacs</a>).</p>
<p>In the world of distributed revision control systems like <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>, forking means something different.  These systems were designed to support a <a href="http://github.com/jamis/capistrano/network">web of related revisions</a>.  Forking is just the way you roll.  A multiplicity of forks is a sign of a healthy developer community.  In fact, <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> advertises the &quot;5 Most Forked Projects&quot; on their home page.</p></p>
