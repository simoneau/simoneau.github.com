If to all of us supposed "haters" Dita gives us something to do in our spare time... like talking shit, well I think it's better that than kissing the ass of someone that hasn't done anything for any of us.
Oh and you don't write "something to do in there spare time", it's "something to do in THEIR spare time"... unless all Dita fans don't know how to spell
