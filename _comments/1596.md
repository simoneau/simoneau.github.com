I'm almost positive that I made orders in 1996 or 1997, but this was the earliest that I could find through Amazon:

Order Date: August 16, 1998
Order #: 002-0998027-9248662
Recipient: Kevin Ahern 
View order
Items:

    * The Unbearable Lightness of Being
    * The God of Small Things
    * Three Novels of Old New York : The House of Mirth, the Custom of the Country, the Age of Innocence
    * Last Exit to Brooklyn
    * Photoshop 5 for Macs for Dummies (For Dummies)

I was pretty surprised that I had kept the same account all the way through.  I've gone through at least 5-10 email addresses in that time.  Although, I should give the caveat that many of these books were not for me. I lived with two women in Queens at the time.  My books were God of Small Things and the Photoshop book.  (OK, I guess that's not any less nerdy. Oh well.)
