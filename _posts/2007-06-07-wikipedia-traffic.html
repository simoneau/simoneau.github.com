<p>This came in over an e-mail list I'm on dedicated to MediaWiki (the software behind Wikipedia).  It's a breakdown of where the traffic comes from for all Wikipedia-related sites: </p>

<p>The answer is Google, mostly.  No surprises here.  In fact, I thought the Google numbers were low until I remembered there that this table doesn't exclude internal traffic from other Wikipedia-related pages (rows #1, #5, #6).  Note that no non-search sites made the short list.  As much as Wikipedia is linked to by other sites, the traffic from these links are negligible (something less than 1.6%) compared to the traffic arriving from searches.</p>
