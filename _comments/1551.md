Grout pond is tent camping only.  (There are also a couple of lean-tos).

You cannot drive to the sites.  It's up to a 1 mile walk from the parking area in to the farthest campsites.  But -- you can drive to a canoe launch, and canoe to the campsites.  There is a pit toilet at the parking area, and a couple of outhouses farther up the trail.  No showers.  It is pretty primitive, but because of the canoe access, you can bring a bit more than a usual primitive camping trip (if you have a canoe to carry it in).

It's a lovely place to camp.  Our very favorite.  Very quiet and peaceful, and there are loons that nest on the pond.  There's a wonderful loop trail around the pond.  Lots of frogs, salamanders and red efts, and raspberries growing wild in season.
