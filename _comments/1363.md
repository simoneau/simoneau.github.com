Elegance never really passes, and although Ms. Sweet's character, Dita, may metamorph  into something different, Ms. Sweet has shown great shrewdness as a business woman. 

 I think she'll do just fine at 40, or 50, or any age.

How she's handled herself in business and the media shows a first rate mind and Midwestern practicality.  Although I'd be delighted to attend one of Dita's shows, I think afternoon tea with Heather would be the the more delightful and memorable hour spent.
