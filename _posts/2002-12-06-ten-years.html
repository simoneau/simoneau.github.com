<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1300.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1300.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>I've posted some <a href="/albums/reunion/">pictures from my 10-year high school reunion</a>.  My camera ditched me at the Roo Bar, traveled to New York City and Princeton University, but eventually returned home.</p>
<p>It is true what they say.  At the 10-year reunion, generally the girls look better than they did in high school and the boys look worse.  The girls have grown up and become mature, self-confident women.  The boys have just gotten older, fatter, and balder.  I think, however, at the 20-year reunion we will have our revenge.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see how everyone is turning out.  Mike Saari gets my award for The Most Interesting Life since high school.  After college, he lived in Germany and worked as a roadie.  He now lives in Welfleet, is involved with theater, and has his own radio show.  He's also been spotted at The Land Ho.</p>
