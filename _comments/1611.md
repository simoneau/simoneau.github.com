There is a difference between "true fork" which is meant to direct project in new direction (usually followed by changing name of the project, Emacs -&gt; XEmacs, Arch -&gt; ArX, GCC -&gt; EGCS, XFree86 -&gt; X.Org) and "so called fork" (by GitHub), which is just copy (clone) of repository, usually meaning just separate branch of development. 

So "most forked projects" on GitHub are just projects with largest number of branches / clones / independent contributors. (It is a bit strange that GitHub follows very early single-branch-per-repository ~= fork/tree paradigm).
