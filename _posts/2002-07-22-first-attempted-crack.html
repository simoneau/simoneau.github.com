<p>Since I've only had this site up for a few days, I still have fun looking at the access logs to see who is visiting.  While perusing, I noticed a series of entries that looks like this:</p>
<p><tt>65.239.144.231 - - [20/Jul/2002:23:32:27 -0500] "POST /cgi-bin/formmail.pl HTTP/1.0" 404 - "http://MATTHEWSIM.COM/contact.htm" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows 95)"</tt></p>
<p>The other URLs that he tried to access are <tt>/cgi-bin/formmail.cgi</tt>, <tt>/cgi-local/formmail.pl</tt>, <tt>/cgibin/formmail.pl</tt>, <tt>/cgi-local/formmail.cgi</tt>, and <tt>/cgibin/formmail.cgi</tt>.  None of these exist on my site.</p>
<p>This looks like someone is trying to use my web site to send e-mail.  <tt>formmail</tt> must be an easily-exploitable CGI that is often installed by default.  Perhaps a spammer is looking for an innocent host to act as relay.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://www.sarangworld.com/TRACEROUTE/">Sarangworld Traceroute Project</a>, I traced <tt>65.239.144.231</tt> to <tt>1Cust231.tnt1.ladue.mo.da.uu.net</tt>, a UUNET customer in Ladue, MO.  </p>
<p>I suspect this sort of thing happens all the time.  As an experiment, I forwarded this information to UUNET's security department and my web provider.  I'll let you know if I receive a reply.</p>
