<p>I've been laid-up sick for the past few days and have had a lot of quality time with an old friend, TV.  Thanks to my ReplayTV, I had a lot of good stuff queued up and waiting for me.</p>
<p>I was watching one of my recorded episodes of The Simpsons, "Jaws Wired Shut".  I know the title because my ReplayTV displays titles on its listing of recorded shows. Usually nobody pays attention to show titles, but now I know that <a href="http://epguides.com/Seinfeld/">episodes of Seinfeld</a> are named after a prominent noun, like "The Contest" or "The Soup Nazi" and <a href="http://www.friends-tv.org/epguide.html">episodes of Friends</a> all start with "The One", like "The One Where Ross and Rachel Take a Break" or "The One with the Breast Milk".  <a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/ql.html">Titles for The Simpsons</a> don't follow a strict pattern, but are usually puns or cultural references, my favorite being "You Only Move Twice" in which Homer moves his family to a new town to work for a super-villain.</p>
<p>Anyways, the "A" plot of this episode, which as usual bears only a tangential connection to rest of the show, was the Simpsons going to a movie.  Actually, you could call this the A2 plot, as the A1 was a brief bit with a gay pride parade.  Homer becomes increasingly enraged at the pre-movie advertisements, previews, and announcements and eventually snaps.</p>
<p>I can identify with this.  As I mentioned, I've been pretty sick for a few days and the only extra-apartment activity I've been up for is going to the movies.  I've started to go a little stir-crazy, so I've seen four movies in two days, namely (ranked in descending order of enjoyment): The Italian Job, 28 Days Later, Hulk, Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.  Yes, Charlie's Angels has a great look and kinda functions as very-soft core porn, but the action sequences and dialog are just stupid.  </p>
<p>So I’ve sat through the pre-show activity at Loews Cineplex Boston Common four times.  Usually don't mind watching the previews.  An exception is the preview for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Title?0266747">Marci X</a>, which tries to entice us with Lisa Kudrow rapping.  Yikes!  Usually, though, the only frustration is that they give away too many juicy plot points and spoil the best one-liners.  The preview for Italian Job is a good example of this. Preceding the previews, however, is a growing sequence of TV-style commercials.  Particularly annoying is dance number from K-mart and Joe Boxer informing me that <a href="http://www.joeboxer.com/media/jb60_1.mpg">there's more to life than underwear</a>.  It only 60 seconds, but seems MUCH longer.  Roger Ebert addressed the issue of pre-movie commercials in a <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/answ-man/sho-sunday-ebert01.html">recent edition</a> of his excellent weekly <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/index/answ-man.html">Movie Answer Man</a> column.</p>
<p>Getting back to "Jaws Wide Shut", I saw it originally in prime time and remembered <a href="/weblog/images/homer.wav">a line from Homer</a> while he's waiting for the movie to start that had gave me a good belly laugh.  The Simpsons is one of the few shows on TV that makes me laugh out loud, so I was looking forward to it.  But it wasn't there.  They cut it out.  When a show moves to syndication, the broadcasters cut bits out to make more time for even more commercials.  I think I heard Shatner once joke that this extra editing is why Star Trek flourished in syndication after doing so poorly originally.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure I was remembering this line correctly, so I fed my guess to Google.  It directed me to <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/scg-13.txt">Simpsons Syndication Cuts Guide, Season 13</a>.  Some serious Simpsons fans have compared the original and syndicated versions second-by-second, and created this annotated reference.  They’ve even developed their own markup to map between the two.  The comment before the line I noticed was missing gives a sense of Frederic Briere’s dedication: "One of the most heavily edited 90 seconds ever! My timings are as accurate as I could make them, but they're all good to within half a second or better."  This is just one of the <a href="http://www.snpp.com/lists.html">many detailed references</a> this site provides.  For example, did you ever want to see <a href="http://www.snpp.com/guides/hutz.file.html#case">Lionel Hutz’s case history</a>?  While I was there I stumbled on some <a href="http://www.snpp.com/news.html#season15">details about the upcoming season 15</a>.  I'm looking forwad to the fall.</p>
