River's party kicked off the Halloween season.  It was the first of many that weekend, and I managed to go to a rehearsal dinner and a wedding, too. 

That's me in the devil mask. It's a soft latex mask that moves with my face. I picked it up at the excellent <a href="http://www.bostoncostume.com">Boston Costume</a> downtown. The top hat was a gift from Senthil a few years ago. He had bought it to wear to a party, but soon realized it was way too big for his head. The department store wouldn't exchange it, so he gave it to me.  This is the first opportunity I've had to wear it.
