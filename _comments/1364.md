I thought Dita WAS Marilyn Manson the first time I saw her photograph.  They wear the same makeup, I think.  She has a great body, but like someone said above - beauty fades, and she's going to be 40 in a few short years.  No way in H*LL will she be able to continue doing that kind of work once she gets liver spots. heehee  Who wants to see a Senior Citizen dancing with a boa and saggy breasts!?  No WONDER Manson dumped her for a newer, younger model!  Meow!  Hiss Hiss!
