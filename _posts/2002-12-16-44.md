<a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1433.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1433.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>My friend Karen and I hosted our first annual Sunday Soiree last weekend.  I've put up <a href="http://www.matthewsim.com/albums/soiree/">lots of pictures</a> from the evening.  One sign of a successful party is seeing people from different groups mingling.  Friends from high school, college, work, and family all had the chance to meet each other.  Thanks to everyone who came, especially my sister who drove up all the way from the Cape.

Also, the Vinal Ave Holiday party on Saturday was great.  I just posted <a href="http://www.matthewsim.com/albums/vinal/">those pictures</a> too.
