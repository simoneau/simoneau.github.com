<p>I was sending someone directions to my office, and I noticed that the placemark that Google Maps puts on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3+Apple+Hill+Drive,+Natick,+MA">the map of the office address</a> is more accurate.  It used to be nearby on Route 9, but is now exactly on my building.</p>
<p>Back in November 2007, Google <a href="http://google-latlong.blogspot.com/2007/11/think-globally-mark-locally.html">introduced a feature</a> to allow <a href="http://maps.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=68474#modify">editing of addresses and other information</a> by anyone with a Google account.  When viewing a placemark, you can now click &quot;Edit&quot; and move it to the right place.  You can also see the history of the edits, which appears in this picture in reverse-chronological order.</p>

<p>You can see Google's original guess with the gray arrow in the lower picture.  It looks like it was moved three times: to the right spot in November, a little off the right spot in January, and then back to the right spot in March.</p>
<p>Community editing is often abused, but I'm coming to expect this degree of interactivity from websites.  When I see something amiss, I'm frustrated when there's not a &quot;submit correction&quot; or at least a &quot;flag spam&quot; link. In this case, I was the happy beneficiary of my peer's contributions.</p>
