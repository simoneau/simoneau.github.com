The best part about this whole thing is the handle "2airishuman".  What an awesome name.  Did you find a new home? I think I heard as much, but no details.  I'm also still interested in collecting telemetry from your 'stream.  It would be very cool to me (for no reason other than having the info) to know when your black water tank is full.  But I bet if you could have your tank send you a text message when it gets to critical levels it would be very useful to you as well.

I have other ideas.
