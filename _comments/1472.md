Just wanted to post my version of Ed.  I thought yours was great as i was gathering reference imagery.  I tried to make mine a bit more sophomoric for an evening of debauchery with friends.  I give you, Edward Partyhands: http://www.tobygrubb.com/projects/051_edw.jpg   with working appendages: lighter, blunt, whiskey nip, syringe, "tobacco" pipe, ky jelly, vibrator, bottle opener.
Kudos!
