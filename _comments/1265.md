Hey, i like those particular greens.

Here in the cold NorthEast zone you can buy a small shoesize box of organic "spring" salad mix...  and those items are usually present, at about 10% of the content.  And, i do like them.

But, i also follow what i'd call a "default animal rule."  If you crave it (food wise, mind you), you're body needs it.  Kinda like those refugee kids in Europan orphanages who kept trying to eat dirt due to long-term mild subnutrition.  So, i say, if you don't like it taste wise, you probably should avoid it; Perhaps your body already has enough of the nutritives it contains.
