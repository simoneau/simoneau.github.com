Maybe it's late, but I'm not seeing what this saves you.  Aren't you just replacing your ugly url with a slightly less ugly Google one?  I thought you were moving toward url rewrites, but then you changed directions on me.

The clock link is great.  I'm always forgetting the time difference in other countries, this is a huge help.  Now if they could make this into one of those desktop widgets, sort of like what the Mac has (or what I've heard Yahoo makes for PCs).  That would be really helpful.  

Nice to see you blogging again!  What's the story for this Halloween???  I'm looking forward to seeing your and Stuart's pics.
