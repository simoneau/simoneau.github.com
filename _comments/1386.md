Okay...doesn't it go without saying how much h*r rocks?!? I mean, seriously. It. Is. The. Awesomest. I think lots of people have come to love sb's emails so much that he's their favorite character now, and I think the emails are the best part of the site, but my favorite character is homsar. One day I hope one of the emails I sent him shows up on there! *crosses fingers*
