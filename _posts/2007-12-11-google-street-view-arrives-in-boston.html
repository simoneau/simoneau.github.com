<p>Google finally added Street View data for Boston.  The first thing I aways do is check Waltham Street, where I used to live.  Here's a shot of my old apartment building:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewsim/2104466118/" title="Google Street View of My Old Apartment by matthewsim, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2267/2104466118_12b52ec173.jpg" width="500" height="390" alt="Google Street View of My Old Apartment" /></a></p>
<p>They let you <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/mm?q=50+Waltham+St,+Boston,+MA+02118,+USA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=42.349791,-71.069098&amp;spn=0.018935,0.031242&amp;z=15&amp;om=1&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=42.342331,-71.069598&amp;cbp=1,571.0961666118563,,0,-13.130095700493671">create a link to a view like this</a>, but it seems to only include the camera position when you use "Link to this page" on the "My Maps" tab.  The range of their coverage is impressive.  Zoom out on the map and you'll see the spidery coverage extending as far as Ware.</p>
