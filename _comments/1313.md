In response to kevin yes she does look like a man&gt;in fact when I first saw her and Manson together I thought it was a publicity stunt.A man in drag pretending to be famous-a skinny guy from Ohio pretending to be interesting.Hey!And you know what is so funny about the girl who disagreed and said she looked so fine without make-up in a velour SWEATSUIT.She "Dita" herself said she would never ne caught dead in Sweats.She is all hype and very intimidated by other beautiful women.She is so rud eto them.I can testify.I cannot stand girls like that.Why hate on others ?I can tell you up close she is rather homely.Also I think this gaze people speak of is boring I think she is predictable and I have never had a girl go after me so viciously just 4 being alive.I think a lot of you would be really upset if you met her and saw how shallow and inswecure she is.Your bubble would indeed be bursted.Sorry.Better you lknow now!
