<p>In the spring, Julie turned me on to the magic of Mel's <a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/">Square Foot Gardening</a>.  An ex-engineer, the main idea of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0878573410/qid=1095983231">his book</a> is that much conventional gardening wisdom is wrong.  Most home gardeners take techniques developed for large-scale farming and misapply them to to their small plots.  I really liked his style and it inspired me to have one of my own.</p>
<p>Here's how it looked when I planted in early June:</p>
<p><a href="http://simoneau.files.wordpress.com/2004/09/dcp_5886.jpg"><img src="http://simoneau.files.wordpress.com/2004/09/dcp_5886.jpg?w=525" alt="DCP_5886" width="525" height="350" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1495" /></a></p>
<p>It is a 7 x 2 square foot bed, filled with <a href="http://www.squarefootgardening.com/html/body_mix_full.html">Mel's Mix</a>.  It was a little tough tracking down the vermiculite, but I eventually found it at at <a href="http://www.griffins.com/">Griffin Greenhouse Supplies</a> in Tewksbury.</p>
<p>Starting from the flowers in the lower left and moving clockwise, I planted cayenne pepper, apple pepper, bell pepper, bell pepper, cucumber, cucumber, peas, tomato, Swiss chard, red leaf and iceberg lettuce, and 6 herbs.  In the last square I planted corn, the only crop I didn't buy pre-sprouted from <a href="http://www.mahoneysgarden.com/">Mahoney's</a>.</p>
