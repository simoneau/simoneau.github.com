We don't have phone service either, but we hacked our TiVo and put in network capabilities, so now we get the onscreen guides and everything too.  It's great, although I miss my DirecTivo that we had in our old building, because it has 2 tuners, enabling you to record 2 shows at once.  I'm pretty sure it's the only one out there that does that.
