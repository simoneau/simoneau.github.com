I'm flying to Chicago in the middle of next week and staying there through the weekend.  I've already updated my <a href="http://www.handspring.com/products/visoredge">Visor Edge</a> by adding Chicago to <a href="http://www.zagat.com/About/software_palm.asp">Zagat's</a> and <a href="http://www.vindigo.com">Vindigo</a>.  If anyone has any advice, please send it along.
