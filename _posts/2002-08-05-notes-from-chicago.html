<p>Tracy and I had a great time in Chicago.  Here are some vignettes.</p>
<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0895.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0895.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>Chicago is famous for it's deep-dish pizza.  <a href="http://www.mit.edu/~dmark/">Karl</a> recommended I try out Gino's East.  I was impressed.  It was unlike any pizza I had ever had.  I've heard people call them "pizza pies" before, but these really are pizza pies.  They are about as thick as a pie and need to be baked for 40 minutes (the server warned me and suggested I order an appetizer).  After finishing two of the four slices in this small, I was uncomfortably full.</p>
<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0934.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0934.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>While cruising down the Miracle Mile (Chicago's fancy-pants shopping street), I decided to swing through FAO Schwartz.  Walking through, I noticed a <a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0933.JPG">Barbie with garters</a>.  Granted, the set included outer clothing to dress her in, and it was supposed to be an historical recreation, but it still caught my eye.  I then noticed that next to this one was a <a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0934.JPG">strictly-lingerie Barbie</a>.  Apparently, this is <a href="http://www.fao.com/products/detail.cfm?objectid=682716D7-BCA3-4A9D-9B840C3726E85CEF&amp;subcategory=4075">one</a> in a <a href="http://www.fao.com/products/detail.cfm?objectid=16629931-F30B-4172-8B4CBE60BC99CA8A&amp;subcategory=4075">series</a> and part of the Limited Edition Fashion Model Collection.  Who exactly is the market for these?  Stopping to take this picture made me feel a little like a dirty old man.</p>
<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0898.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0898.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>Speaking of which, I also noticed that the Borders on the same street makes no distinction between magazines for men and men's magazines.  That is, they shelve Maxim and Stuff interleaved with Playboy and <a href="http://www.perfect10.com/">Perfect 10</a>.  I've never seen this in Boston.  Is this common in other (less Puritan) parts of the country?</p>
