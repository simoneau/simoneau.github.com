If somebody has had the same problems, please let me know.  I cannot get customer service because I cannot understand them.  When I can, they have no clue.  I have recieved 6 software "fixes" and am on my 3rd unit (that they were going to make me pay for shipping until i complained enought).  They will not refund my money for the unit or my sevice.  I have never dealt with a company like this and think that maybe I can get help if I have a number of irritated consumers.  Please let me know Mike 602-312-6116
