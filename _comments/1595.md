Once again, I'm amazed at your skill, Matt.  Not only do you find the "Neat Thing Of The Day", NTOTD, but also you used the phrase honkey-tonk!  

Well played.

Of course, I had to check my Amazon history right quick and came across my first order, October 23, 1998.  (kicking your double-major ass, btw) I bought the children's book "Old Turtle" on behalf of my parents for my nephew.  Not sure why October was significant.

Again, well played.
