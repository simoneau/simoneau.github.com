Before posting another lame comment, SCROLL UP TO SEE STUART'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING SCISSOR HANDS.

Griffin asked about my costume.  The easiest way to make a William Wallace Braveheart costume is to have a slightly obsessive friend make one for himself, and then borrow it a couple years later.  If that's not an option, here are the basic ingredients:

* Tina Turner wig, trimmed and braided.
* wooden sword wrapped in duct tape with drops of red paint on it to simulate English blood
* leather belts to hold the sword and to throw over your shoulder
* blue face paint from your local Halloween store
* a long piece of fabric to wrap around your waist  several times and throw over your shoulder, held in place with safety pins
* an earth-tone T-shirt
* boots
* no underwear required
