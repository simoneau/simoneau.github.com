i dont know about manson being happier since they have been together but i do remember an interview with dita on her web in the beginning right before they started "dating",and they had asked her if marilyn manson was in fact her type she said "no", they asked what her type of man was she said and i DO quote"trent reznor from a perfect drug". manson seems out of it to me and his expression is and always has been sad and empty...
