I was in New York City. Just after I arrived, the snow started to fall pretty heavily. It didn't stop for two days. Since I was just visiting a friend and didn't really have anywhere I needed to be, it was an interesting time to be down there. I spent most of President's Day walking around the city and taking it all in. It was great to see New Yorkers cross-country skiing through the middle of Times Square. It made me feel like I was in a cheesy post-apocalyptic SF story.</p>
