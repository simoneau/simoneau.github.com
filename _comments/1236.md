matt, 
the answer is this:
in a plastic grocery bag;
1)bring your cereal in a tupperware bowl.
2)bring a spoon. 
3)use your cereal container as your cereal bowl. 
4)when youre done, wash it and the spoon in the kitchen at work and put it back into the bag to take home.

there is some logic here;
1)the tupperware container will keep your cereal crispy (until you dump in the milk) and will keep it from spilling en-route to work
2)you will always have utensils of the appropriate size and shape for cereal eating.
3)the plastic bag will keep your wet dishes from dripping all over (if you arent into drying them)
4)you will always have hygenic items with which to eat your breakfast. 
5)using resuable containers and utensils is much better for the environment.

see, ive done this before. had similar difficulties (ever try eating yogurt with a fork?)and so i came up with a better solution than digging through the drawers and cabinets of a communal kitchen. usually what you find from such searches is really unfit for use unless it is autoclaved first. 

good luck with this issue!
