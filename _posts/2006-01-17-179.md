Microsoft is playing catch-up with Google with their "Windows Live" brand.  They released an online mapping website, <a href="http://local.live.com">Windows Live Local</a>.  Their interface isn't as good as Google Maps, e.g. you can't pan between tiles in "Bird's Eye" view.  They do, however, have higher resolution data for Boston.  For example, you can clearly see <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=42.342093~-71.069669&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;scene=3137389&amp;sp=aN.42.342132_-71.069691_My deck_">the deck of my apartment</a> (pictured), <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=42.300085~-71.350965&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;scene=3071973&amp;sp=aN.42.300085_-71.350965_My office window_">my office window</a>, and <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=41.670586~-70.154215&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;scene=2977305&amp;sp=aN.41.670564_-70.154204_My parent's house_">my parent's house</a>.
