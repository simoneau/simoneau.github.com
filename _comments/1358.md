I really envy all the people who have met Dita in person!  I really admire her, and unlike all the nasty judgmental people out there, I do not expect her to be perfect, yet I am capable of seeing how creative she is and how doing what she loves has made her successful.  So what if she isn't the prettiest woman on earth?  She is very entertaining to all those who love the retro revival, and there is nothing wrong with that.  She is beautiful in her own unique way, and it's quite refreshing in comparison to all the Paris Hilton wannabes out there!  
Also, I have noticed that everyone has a very strong opinion about Dita and her being married to Manson.  Face it: they are perfect for eachother for the very simple and obvious reason that they both live to dress up, and they both have the same insecurities of being too "plain" or too "normal" on the outside, but they have both managed to transform their weaknessess into strengths!  I think that they are in fact a very good example of a couple who support eachother because they both love the same things, and we can all learn from that.  If we ever want to be happy in both love AND in our careers, we simply need to take a stand and do exactly what we love.
