I love Dita i never met her or saw a show but i used to email her at dita.net and sometimes i got a reply.I asked her why not have a section of her and Manson her responce was she doesn't want to publicise the relationship .She did however send me a press pic of her and Manson and now that pic is a regular pic.I myself heard from a girl who wanted Manson's autograph and dita jumped in to stop her and was very rude.The funny part is the poor girl got the autograph anyway.I don't think dita should interfere with manson's fans and his interaction with them  that part has nothing to do with her .I think your personal life should never be on the road with you and mixing with your job Manson did that with Rose mcgowan but unlike dita rose was cool with the fans they adored her.
