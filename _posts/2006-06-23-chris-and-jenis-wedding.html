<p>Chris and Jeni, two of my oldest friends, got married on May 28th.  </p>
<p>I've known Jeni since we started violin/viola classes together in the third grade.  I became friends with Chris sharing a tent as camp counselors the summer before we started high school.</p>
<p>Congratulations to you both!</p>
