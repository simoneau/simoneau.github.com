<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewsim/2638200158/" title="Bridge of Flowers by matthewsim, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2638200158_7c5c28fe3e_t.jpg" width="67" height="100" alt="Bridge of Flowers" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>Another stop on the way back from the Summer Outing was at the small town of <a href="http://www.shelburnefalls.com">Shelburne Falls</a>, home of the Bridge of Flowers.  In 1929, the town converted an abandoned 400-foot long trolley bridge into a flower garden.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewsim/2638200628/" title="Swimmin' Hole by matthewsim, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3014/2638200628_fff201bfaf_t.jpg" width="100" height="67" alt="Swimmin' Hole" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>A much cooler sight, however, is across the street.  At the end of the last ice age, the water flowing through the Deerfield River bored holes in the riverbed by pushing stones in circular patterns.  For part of the year, the hydroelectric dam upstream stops the river enough to expose these glacial potholes.  This geological wonder is also a popular local swimming hole.</p>

Click on this wide image to try it out.  If you have <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">QuickTime</a> installed, you'll be able to pan around in 3-D with your mouse.  Nice effect, eh?  I stood on a rock in the middle of the river and took about a dozen pictures, turning a little each time and overlapping a little bit with the previous one.  I then fed them through a program called <a href="http://www.panoramafactory.com/">The Panorama Factory</a>, which automatically stitches them together and saves them out as QuickTime VR.  There are lots of programs that can do this, but The Panorama Factory is effective, easy to use, free to try, and cheap to buy.</p>
