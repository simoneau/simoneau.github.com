I moved my blogging platform from self-hosted [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) to [GitHub](https://github.com)-hosted [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I don't recommend this to anyone who isn't a programmer, but I've already gotten a lot of satisfaction out of making my chages as [commits](https://github.com/simoneau/simoneau.github.com/commits/master) (with all the benefits of revision control) instead of opaque updates to a database.
