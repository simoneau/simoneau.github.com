Matthew, just thought I'd let you know that I'd buy that Lingerie Barbie. In fact, I have several. I've been a collector of Barbie dolls since the early '90s and the quality of this line is great! I don't see the doll as "sexy," since it is an inanimate object. And, you must admit, the doll shows less than some Victoria's Secret models.
