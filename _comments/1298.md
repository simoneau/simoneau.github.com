Unsure if these comments are from this year or not since there's no year on the date of posts.

If these posts are from 2003 or 2004 I feel sorry for any of you that bought a replaytv since the parent company Sonicblue went out of business due to just the sorts of complaints I'm reading here. If it's not in the script the Indian support people can't help you.

Pretty much any company that was formerly good that was subsequently purchased by sonicblue is suspect. This applies to diamond multimedia and rio. Both decent brands until sonicblue acquired them. Buyer beware ;)
