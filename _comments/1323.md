I don't believe that fake story about Dita stopping a fan from getting an autograph, because me and my friends got to meet Marilyn thanks to Dita taking us backstage.
People LOVE to make up stuff. Its more exciting to say she was mean than to say she was pleasant...its that dirty laundry thing.
And Marilyn says in interviews that rose hated what he does for a living and was jealous of his fame. she is SO boring too. I read an interview and she actually said that she didn't think that aaron spelling had ever heard of marilyn manson. yeah right! like anyone knew who she was before she dated him!
