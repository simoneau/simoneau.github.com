We also would like to use your photo of the cubit in our training at Quametec Institute of Measurement Technology. http://quametec.com

We just happen to have replicas of the Egyptian Cubit. If you would like one, email me with your phone number and I will see what I can do to send one your way.

The replica is made of material that simulates black granite. I have one on my mantle along with a poster which contains the story of the cubit and a hieroglyph of "judgement day". (This comes with the cubit.)

Although using your picture saves me time and trouble. Thanks!

Sincerely,
James Jenkins
