<p>Jerry Seinfeld's new movie, "Comedian" is due out this fall.  It is a combination documentary/concert-film about his return to standup.  The <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/comedian.html">recently released trailer</a>, however, has nothing to do with the content of the film.  Rather, it pokes fun of the formula that most movie trailers follow: start with serious-sounding voiceover and build momentum with explosions and "funny" lines from the movie.  It features Hal Douglas, the most recognizable in-a-world voice, playing himself and does a great job poking fun of the over-used stock phrases.</p>
