<a href="/weblog/images/dita.jpg"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/dita.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>Last month, a couple of friends (who shall remain nameless to protect the not-so-innocent) and I went to see <a href="http://www.dita.net">Dita Von Teese</a> perform at a local club.  We saw her signature act where, after removing her complicated clothing, she climbs into a gigantic martini glass.  As a nice touch, she then bathes with an olive-shaped sponge that's about the size of her head.  With her 50's "Bettie Page" film-noir often-corseted look, she's become the cover girl for the current burlesque revival.  She put on quite a show and I'm a sucker for her glamorous vintage look.  She's making another rare public appearance at Man Ray (which is a show in itself) this Friday.  Send me an e-mail if you want to join me.
