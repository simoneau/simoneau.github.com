<p>I saw Steve Sweeney live ages ago, mainly doing the same material <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHnc2GGcs4o">he does here</a>.  I've always remembered his Bostonians'-take-on-weather bit, and it's been popping back into my mind as people discuss the beautiful weekend weather swinging back into snow on Monday.  Starting around <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHnc2GGcs4o#t=4m10s">4:10</a>, paraphrased:</p>
<p>"Positive people we are."</p>
<p>You: "Jeez, it's a nice day."<br />
Bostonian: "Ya, we won't get many more like these."</p>
<p>You: "Jeez, it's a nice day."<br />
Bostonian: "Ya, well we waited long enough."</p>
<p>You: "Jeez, it's a nice day."<br />
Bostonian: "Ya, outside!  I'm inside."</p>
