I'm assembling a teen wolf costume this year for halloween. I found a "Beavers 42" t-shirt on e-bay that I bought. Also, purchased a "Chewbacca" full body fur suit from another site. All that's left is to find some short yellow basketball shorts, pair of tube socks, and fake beard and werewolf hair. Should be great. Can't wait for All Hallows Eve.
