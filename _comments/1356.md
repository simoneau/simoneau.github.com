i have met miss dita in person. And let me just say she is no lady! She is rude, and she doesnt appreciate her fans at all. She laughs that she gets paid 20,000 per performance. And her fans are what make her and she treats them like shit!! She better be careful cause she is getting older and beauty fades as we all know. And there is always someone around the corner younger, fresher and prettier. So if i were her i would kiss her fans ass'es. I mean come on. Who couldnt do what she does?? Not like she cant be replaced. I thinks she should get off her high horse and come back down to earth!! And i agree from a distance she is really pretty but up close she is rather fugly!! No wonder she wants to keep her fans at bay!! Cause if they got to close they would see her for the bow wow she really is behind all the make-up!!
