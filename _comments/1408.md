Hey Matt, I'm glad you posted pics of the burial site and the chapel and the campground across the street. Jay's death affected me deeply, and in thinking about it, still brings me great sadness. Has there ever been any conclusive findings about the circumstances of his death? I've tried to find the Boston Coroner's office report of his death, but no luck.... hope you are doing well these days. Geoff and I moved to Ottawa in January, which has been a good move for us.
