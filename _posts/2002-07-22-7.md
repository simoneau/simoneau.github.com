When I was walking through Vondelpark in Amsterdam, I noticed the groups of locals who had gathered to chat with each other, get a little fresh air, eat a little food, and generally relax.  This inspired me to invite a group out to the Boston Public Gardens yesterday.  Thanks to everyone who came out.  I had a great time.
