Hi! We noticed that you mention Ali Davis' "True Porn Clerk Stories" on your site. Did you know that Ali will be performing her one-woman show based on the hilarious excerpts from her journal? It's happening in NYC at the Upright Citizen's Theatre on July 14th. If you'd share this info with your readers, we'd greatly appreciate it.  Ali knows that her major support has come through the internet!   If you are interested in more details, I can forward them to you!
 
Best,
Kelli Hogg
