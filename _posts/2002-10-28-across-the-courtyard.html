<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1022_circle.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1022_circle.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>I moved into a new apartment in the South End at the end of the summer.  One of the greatest perks of my new place is that it has a deck overlooking a courtyard.  A couple weeks ago, there was an open house at an apartment across the courtyard from mine.  I was able to snap this shot of my deck from their balcony.  Mine has the red circle around it.  It's a pretty large deck and is now populated with some wicker furniture (courtesy of my parents). Unfortunately, it's now too cold to host a dinner party on it, but I definitely will start using it heavily in the spring.</p>
