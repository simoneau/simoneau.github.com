The company I work for is 20 years old.  For a software company, this is a long time.  To celebrate, we took a three day trip to Walt Disney World.  We stayed at the Yacht and Beach Club Resort (traveling from Boston to Orlando to stay in a New England themed resort is a little strange).  We held our meetings and saw fireworks at Epcot, spent an afternoon in the Magic Kingdom, had dinner and entertainment in the Animal Kingdom, and went out to the BoardWalk and Pleasure Island.
