Man, I love listening to rebroadcasts of <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> talks on my iPod during my commute.  Sadly, I'm not interesting enough to be invited to attend, but by becoming an <a href="http://www.ted.com/associates">associate member</a> ($1000), I can access a live webcast of the TED conference and show it to ten of my friends.

This year I'll be on a cruise, but it would be fun to organize a TED Boston in 2010.  I could get together 10 interesting people, take a couple days off from work, watch the conference together, and chat about it.
