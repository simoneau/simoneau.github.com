Hi, just wasting time surfing and ran across your nice pictures...
I was wondering if "Brynna (visiting from Mars)" perhaps studied at the University of Utah in about 1982ish and was my roommate- no offence if she's much younger!!!  The picture is a bit distorted because of pulling silly faces! If she is the Brynna I'm thinking of, please, drop a quick note and or send on my email address to her. I've been living in Germany for 20 years - so it would be fun so drop her a line.  If she'es not, please send a a short note, so I won't wonder the rest of my life ;)

Thanks,
Karen
