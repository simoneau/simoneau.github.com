<p><a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1061.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1061.JPG" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>When I told US Airways that they lost my suitcase, they gave me an emergency toiletries kit.  It came wrapped in a plastic bag with this label:</p>
<p><tt>BAG - MADE IN CHINA<br />PLASTIC ITEMS - MADE IN CHINA<br />VANITY SET - MADE IN CHINA<br />TOOTHPASTE - MADE IN U.S.A<br />SHAVE CREAM - MADE IN INDIA<br />WASH PACKET - MADE IN U.S.A.<br />RAZOR - MADE IN EGYPT<br />DEODORANT - MADE IN U.S.A.<br />GLIDE FLOSS SACHET - MADE IN U.S.A.<br /></tt></p>
<p>I guess this is what they mean by "the global economy".</p>
