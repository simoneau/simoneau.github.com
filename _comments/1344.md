I knew Dita when she was starting at Captain Cream, she had a room mate who danced by the name Mina.  Both names were taken from the Dracula book of which they were fans.  She was over for dinner in my home many times and I was around her a good bit at the time and can only say that she was always very polite and well mannered, she was well liked by the other dancers at the club and exhibited none of the negative traits mentioned in earlier comments.  Even back then she was creative with her stage act and it was obvious she would be able to translate that creativity into greater success.  Those man coments and others about her looks are amazingly out of whack with reality.  I have known many women in and out of modeling/dancing and Heather was as delicate a beauty as any I knew.
