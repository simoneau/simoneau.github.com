I'm on the team that runs the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/contest">MATLAB Programming Contest</a>.  The contest has evolved into a week-long <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/contest/">series of mini-contests</a>, each with its own deadline.  We post all deadlines relative to our own clocks in Natick, MA, but we have contestants playing in real-time from all over the world.  I just stumbled on a simple tool that can help them out.  

Simply <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html">fill out a form</a> giving your location and the desired time, and it returns a page translating that moment in time to all the clocks of the world.  For example, we can say that the contest ends at <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=5&amp;day=16&amp;year=2007&amp;hour=12&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=43">noon on Wednesday</a>, and clicking the link will let contestants know what this is in their local time.  The can even set <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/setpersonal.html">their location</a> to see just the time they care about.
