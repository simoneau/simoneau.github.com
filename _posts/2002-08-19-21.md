<a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0955.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0955.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>I took this picture a week ago at a pub night Claire called at the <a href="http://www.theindo.com/">Independent</a>.  Can you identify the owners of these toes?  Aren't they pretty?  (Yes, I have since cut my toenails.)  You probably aren't interested uness you were there, but I also posted <a href="/albums/independent/">the other pictures</a> I took that night.
