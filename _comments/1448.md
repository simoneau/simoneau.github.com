O.K. here are the detals of how you can look like Edward:

Scissor ingredients:
* Pair of cheap (fake leather) gloves 
* Plastic corrugated card (~4mm thick) from a craft shop that you can cut into shapes
* Duck tape
* Acrylic paint (grey, red, black)
* Matt grey spray paint, washers, nuts and glue (Optional)

Scissor construction directions:
* Cut card into scissor shaped pieces: Long ones (~2 feet) for 2 fore fingers on each hand, shorter ones for rest. Double or treble the card layers at top to make thicker. 
* Look at the DVD to see the different shaped finger pieces
* Cover fingers each in duck tape
* Cut card into various scissor handle shapes and attached to main scissor sections. Cover in duck tape
* Attach to gloves (side on) so they move with your fingers
* Add box shape to build-up back of hands cover in duck tape
* Cover all of gloves with duck tape
* Optionally spray all over with matt grey paint
* Touch up handles and fingers with red, black and grey paint
* Optionally glue on paint on nuts 

Make-up:
* Eyebrow plastic to hide eyebrows
* Liquid Latex for cuts
* Cream make-up: Geisha (for most of face), black and light tan (mixed for eyes, cheeks and lips)
* (Ask make-up shop for advice and show them a picture)

Other costume bits:
* Neck belts
* Black shirt (underneath), collar up
* White shirt
* Suspenders (US)/braces (UK), cut and held with safely pins
* Old grey suit trousers
* Wig cut to stand-up and LOTS of hairspray

Notes:
* I found it tough to get the gloves off once they were on
* Move your fingers a bit when you walk and keep the long fingers separated like scissors so you don't look like Freddy Kruger. Hold arms out a bit from body.
* Shuffle a bit and keep your neck stiff
* Take straw for drink
* Find trusted friend to manage taking your wallet out of your back pocket for getting drinks
* Acting a bit sad like Edward will reward you with many hugs and photo ops from most girls (open arms expectedly and shuffle forwards)

Good Luck,

Stuart
