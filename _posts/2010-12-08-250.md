There are no closets in the bedroom, so I wanted to build a wall of shelves for storage. We were inspired by a picture in <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/chicago/house-tours/house-tour-shannon-and-emmetts-from-factory-to-family-007338">House Tour: Shannon and Emmett's From Factory to Family</a> that Molly found on <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/" rel="nofollow">apartment therapy</a>.

We picked up the pine boards, the lengths of pipe, and a nice dark stain at Home Depot. Several days of work and as many trips back to Home Depot, viola. The top three shelves are 12"x10', the bottom one is (2x10")x12', and there is 8' of rod hanging below.

Our clothes, which have been piled on the floor for several months, finally have a place to live. Originally I planed to just stack everything on the shelves directly, but Molly suggested buying a set of attractive boxes for storage. After seeing my underwear piled up there, I know that's the way to go.
