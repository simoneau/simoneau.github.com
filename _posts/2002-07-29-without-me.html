<p><img src="/weblog/images/theeminemshow.jpg" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" />I saw the <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/musicvideos/player/default.asp?videoID=1084344">video</a> for Eminem's new single, Without Me, on MTV a couple times.  It's been stuck in my head ever since.  It doesn't help that the tempo of the song is about the same as a brisk walk and its heavy downbeats make it feel like a march.  Yes, the <a href="http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/eminem/the_show/without.mnm.txt">lyrics</a> are certainly abrasive, including even an <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453610/20020426/story.jhtml">attack on Moby</a>.  They are also full of clever little turns of phrase that, in Eminem's own words, have a way of "infesting in your kids' ears and nesting."  If anyone has an antidote, please send it along.</p>
