<p>I've been following <a href="http://www.longnow.com/">The Long Now Foundation</a> for some time, starting with the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/scenarios/clock.html">essay in Wired Magazine in 1995</a> which inspired it.  Its mission is to inspire long-term thinking in a world with an increasingly short time horizon.  They organize around <a href="http://longnow.org/projects/">several projects</a>, but their signature effort is to build a <a href="http://longnow.org/clock/">clock that will run for 10,000 years</a>.</p>
<p>They've purchased a mountaintop in Nevada to house the clock.  Stuart Brand described their progress in <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/stewart_brand_on_the_long_now.html">this 2004 TED talk</a>.  Last spring they issued a <a href="http://longnow.org/membership/newsletters/02009-june-solstice/#membernvguide">a call for guides</a>.  I answered.</p>
<p>About 40 of us spent the weekend in Nevada, becoming familiar with the mountain and making infrastructure improvements to the base camp. We also spent a lot of time getting to know one another. This self-selected group was an interesting bunch. Over the campfire one night, Stuart called us the clock's first docents.</p>
<p>They're holding an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> about long-term thinking in June, and I'll be back to help.</p>
