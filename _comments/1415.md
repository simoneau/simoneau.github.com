I was just thinking about Jay today.  He was my younger cousin and I knew him all his life.  I still miss seeing him from time to time at family gatherings.  

We both attended USD at the same time so I got to know him better then.  It is amazing how many lives Jay touched.

I was wondering if Jay's web site was taken down.  Could you send me an e-mail and let me know?

Thanks,
Gerald
