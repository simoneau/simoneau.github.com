<p>I'm on the design team for <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/">MATLAB Central</a>, the MathWorks online community.  Whenever we solicit feedback, we always hear from a user &quot;joking&quot; about adding a dating service.<br />
<br />
True to form, it wasn't long after I created the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/MATLAB/21222876640">MATLAB fan page</a> on Facebook for similar comments to start showing up on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/wall.php?id=21222876640">MATLAB's wall</a>.  An excerpt is pictured here.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note, the MATLAB fan page has already grown to 2,434 fans without any promotion at all.  Crazy.</p>
