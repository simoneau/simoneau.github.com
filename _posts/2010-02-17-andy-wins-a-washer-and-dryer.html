<p>My cousin Andy, who had never been to Las Vegas before, was excited to go to <a href="http://www.priceisrightlive.com/">The Price Is Right Live!</a> at  Bally's Las Vegas.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, he was chosen at random to go to Contestant's Row, where it was not <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthewsim/4312285163/in/set-72157623222092741/">his ability to price outdoor space heaters</a>, but his savy game play (going for the classic &quot;$1!&quot; bet) which won him the round.</p>
<p>Up on stage, his mastery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Price_Is_Right_pricing_games#Cliff_Hangers">Cliff Hangers</a> earned him a washer dryer set, along with shipping anywhere in the continental United States. They are on their way to his parents' house right now, who will enjoy them until he moves into a bigger place.</p>

<p>The hosts <a href="http://www.toddnewtononline.com/">Todd Newton</a> and <a href="http://www.davidruprecht.com/">David Ruprecht</a>, who both did a wonderful job, stuck around to have a drink at the bar with us after the show.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to make friends in Las Vegas, walk around with your Price Is Right name tag and have a good story about your cousin winning a washer/dryer set.</p>
