At work, I'm the maintainer of some company internal standards.  Some of them link to a section of of our public online documentation.  The system that produces this doc doesn't produce <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">cool URLs</a>.  They are long, ugly, and change every time we do a major software release.

<strong>Q:</strong> How can I get out of the business of updating these URLs every six months?
<strong>A: </strong>Hack Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#lucky">"I'm Feeling Lucky" button</a>.  

Google crawls our site regularly and will always know where this page lives.  If I tell Google what I want to link to, it will always know what the right URL is.  By inspecting the HTML behind Google's submit form, I came up with the following procedure.

First, figure out a search query that will always return the page you want as the first result.  Here is what I typed into Google's search box:

<code>"Marking Up Text in Cells for Publishing" site:www.mathworks.com</code>

I'm using two good search tricks here.  First, I use quotes to surround the exact title of the section of the doc I want to reference.  These individual words appear all over the doc, but this exact phrase is only on this page and pages that reference it.   Secondly, I use the <code>site:</code> directive so the results will include only results for our website.  I use this trick all the time (usually via the "Search only items on the current Web site" button on the Google Toolbar).  Between the two of these, I can feel confident of finding the exact page I want.

I press "I'm Feeling Lucky" and confirm that Google indeed takes me to the desired page.  Now I need to hack a URL that will do the same thing.  I go back to the search page and press the usual "Google Search" button.  Copy the URL in the search bar to use as your link, which looks something like this:

<code>http&#058;//www.google.com/search ... &amp;btnG=Google+Search</code>

If you used this as-is, clicking on the link would bring you to the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Marking+Up+Text+in+Cells+for+Publishing%22+site%3Amathworks.com&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Google Search results</a>.  To make it skip the results and go straight to the first result, we just need to tweak it a little.  Find "btnG" in the URL and change it to "btnI".  Now the link will take you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22Marking+Up+Text+in+Cells+for+Publishing%22+site%3Amathworks.com&amp;btnI=Google+Search">straight to the desired page</a>
