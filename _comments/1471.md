I was also amazed by the Teen Wolf costume.  I have been able to scrounge up the basketball uniform, but was wondering where he found the werewolf make-up for the hairy arms, face and legs?  Any hints/tips would be greatly appreciated so Teen Wolf can make an appearance in my small Minnesota town for next Halloween.
