<p><a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a> animation site was all the rage back in 2003.  I even <a href="https://www.matthewsim.com/weblog/60/">blogged about it</a>.  Five years later, my The Cheat T-shirt is still in the wardrobe rotation.  I even stop by the site occasionally to see what's new.  It's impressively meta and self-referential, with many of the pieces &quot;created&quot; by the characters themselves.</p>
<p>I always make a point to stop in after Halloween to listen to Strong Bad ridicule costumes based on the site.  The <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/costumes08.html">latest installment</a> is good.  It's funnier if you can follow all the characters and references, dutifully recorded <a href="http://www.hrwiki.org/index.php/Fan_Costumes_'08">this episode's page in the wiki</a>, but you may find it fun just to hear Strong Bad go at it.</p>
