ah matt the woes of travelling. had pretty good luck with baggage etc. on the romania trip, i was certain that something was going to get lost due to my preconceived notions about the conditions of eastern european airports. in fact, the entire baggage situation was quite efficient. in bucharest before you got to the check in all your things went through the xray rather than going through the ticket line and getting sent back to go 100 yards to the nearest xray machine where you get hassled by the xray guys because your bag has a strange shape inside it (and who think its funny to threaten to not give you back your tickets... ho ho hee hee!!)and then sent back to the ticket counter so that the bag can be put on the belt to go through. this was the scene at reagan national several months ago. perhaps its changed but knowing american bureaucracy it probably hasnt. the europeans seem to have an understanding of security and how to go about enforcing it with minimal inconvenience. i do not mind the concern for providing security measures however it does nothing to make me feel safer when i see two teenage "security guards" more intent on feeling each other up than catching prospective terrorists during a preboarding search. if the faa is going to bother with this nonsense they might as well take it seriously.
