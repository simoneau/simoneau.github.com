Hi Matthew. I had the privilege of working for Jay when he was here in Ann Arbor. I was shocked when I heard of his death. It has been a year since he passed away and I still check his web site, pretty regularly. I am hoping to get privately in touch with you and I would be grateful if you could write me to the email address that I left.
Andrea
