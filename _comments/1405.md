I was shocked to read about Jay's death in the USD Alumni newspaper a few months back.  I had lived in the same dorm that Jay had lived in and was a friend of his sister while she attended USD.  Jay and I weren't best friends or anything like that while we were at the U, but his death made me do some deep reevaluating of my life.  I remember him walking around our floor going in and out of the building with his cello case.  I always thought he seemed to be such an intriguing guy, but I never got to know as well as I should have.  I would like to ask you some questions if you would be willing to respond to the e-mail address I provided.
