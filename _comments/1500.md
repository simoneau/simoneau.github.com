Hey Matt.  I remember you. I was the guy in the Ted William's costume that year.  'Nice to have stumbled across your site as I didn't get too many pics of myself cuz I could hardly see. Fortunately, between 4 parties, I did win a total of $2,500.00 in cash and an all expenses paid trip for 2 to Gran Lido Braco in Jamaica !!!  Ted's Cryo-container now sits proudly behind my bar.


Send me pics of what you do this year.
