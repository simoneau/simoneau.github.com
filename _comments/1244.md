Somewhere along the line I think people have started acknowledging that the distinction between "soft porn" (maxim, fhm, et.al.) and "real" porn (playboy, whoohooo!) is pretty flimsy ( about 2mm of silk to be exact ).  

I haven't figured out whether this is just a ploy of the shopkeepers to make me feel tawdry, or if there really is no distinction between enjoying nudity and enjoying semi-nudity... hmmmm.
