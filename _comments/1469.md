im also going to be edward scissorhands.  i was at a local costume store and found the best possible wig for the costume.  its called a caveman's wig and it also comes with a beard.  just use the wig, it is the closest thing i have seen to his hair in the movie without having to use hairspray and other things to make it look better.
