Have owned a Panasonic Showstopper (I believe it's the model 3000, one of the early several ReplayTV units) for about one year. The most I had to do was to reset the unit a couple of times because it hung up. It has never failed otherwise (this must be because I purchased a 3 yr warranty plan with it). Now I wish I had more recording time (it is only 30 hours). It has definitely changed the way I watch TV (less time in front of the screen, watching just what I choose, and no chaff in between). What a joy.
