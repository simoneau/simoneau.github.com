Dear Matthew,

After taking your advice and visiting Grout Pond, I'd like to express my profound disappointment with the camp site - specifically campsite #7.  There was more than just a bit of mud Matthew, there was a river running underneath the firepit!  Thanks my great advice, Matthew - as dense as you seem, I'm sure you're recognizing my sarcasm.

Not only did my friends and I have to lug all our camping equiptment through a virtual stream-bed, when we arrived at the site we were deeply troubled to find broken glass and empty beer cans strewn all over the tenting areas.  We were also quite displeased to find out that by your over promotion of Grout Pond, we were accosted by a number of rude out of staters - we could only assume that your blogging efforts made this site known to many people who apparently have next to no respect for Mother Nature.  So, thanks again for totally blowing the lid off of a spot that was ONCE cool and turning into a sickening tourist trap.

Matthew, please please cease and desist with your blog and stay out of Vermont and keep your riff-raff crowd out of this great state as well.
