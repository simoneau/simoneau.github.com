<a href="/weblog/images/DCP_1028.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_1028.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>Everyday on my way to work I pass what I believe to be the largest wild mushroom in all of Boston.  I have no proof it is the largest, but nobody has been able to show me a counterexample.  It looks like an old, rotting tree stump has just the right amount of shade and moisture for ideal fungus-growing conditions.  The mushroom has even started to flow out over the curb.  If you'd like to see it for yourself, it is on Clarendon Street nearly opposite the DeLux.  Then go to the DeLux and have their Tuscan sandwich.  It is delicious.
