<p>On the night before Halloween, Avalon was advertising a "Pimp and Hos Ball".  I thought it might be fun, so Stuart dressed up as a pimp and I dressed up as Hugh Hefner, the ultimate pimp.  Avalon was packed, but we were very nearly the only ones there who were dressed up.  It made for a good conversation starter!  And of course, being Avalon, there were still lots of not-wearing-a-costume pimps and hos.</p>
