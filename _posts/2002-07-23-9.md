<a href="/weblog/images/DCP_0889.JPG"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/DCP_0889.JPG" align="left" style="margin-right:10px;" /></a>I work at an office out in the suburbs.  I counter-commute via train everyday from my apartment in the South End of Boston.  The train I usually take gets me into work around 9:45.  After a quick check of my e-mail and voicemail, I like to have a bowl of Raisin Bran.  By this time, however, it is about 10AM and all the bowls and spoons in our kitchen are dirty.  I've learned to improvise.  Today I used a plastic sandwich container and a salad spoon.  This wasn't too bad, but the spoon didn't fit in my mouth comfortably and fishing the bran out of the corners of the container was a little tricky.  Still, this is better than using ice-cream scoop.  Or a fork.
