<p><a href="/weblog/images/trinity.jpg"><img src="/weblog/thumbnails/trinity.jpg" align="right" style="margin-left:10px;" /></a>I won't give a full review of The Matrix Reloaded, the most discussed movie in the history of the Internet, but I will share my favorite moment.  (Minor spoilers ahead.)  When Trinity coldly delivers the last line in this exchange, her quiet rage gives me shivers.</p>
<p>Link: Jesus.  As soon as they open that door, it's all over.<br />
Trinity: The hell it is.<br />
Link: What are you doing?  Trinity?<br />
Trinity: I will not stand here and do nothing.  I will not wait here to watch them die.<br />
Link: Trinity, we're talking less than five minutes here.<br />
Trinity:  In five minutes, I'll tear that whole goddamn building down.</p>
<p>And she's serious.  In Neo's fight scenes, nigh-invincible combatants merely <a href="http://mediaframe.yahoo.com/launch?lid=rnv-56-p.1188411-108421,rnv-100-p.1188412-108421,rnv-300-p.1188413-108421,wmv-56-p.1188414-108421,wmv-100-p.1188415-108421,wmv-300-p.1188416-108421">push each other around for a while</a>.  Trinity's are more interesting.  She's either struggling to stay alive against an agent or, as in this case, <a href="http://mediaframe.yahoo.com/launch?lid=wmv-300-p.1188392-108417,rnv-56-p.1188387-108417,rnv-100-p.1188388-108417,wmv-56-p.1188390-108417,rnv-300-p.1188389-108417,wmv-100-p.1188391-108417">dropping a half-dozen humans</a> in as many seconds.  While wearing a skin-tight latex bodysuit.</p>
