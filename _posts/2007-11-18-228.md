While walking by Fenway Park last night around 11PM, I saw a stream of sparks raining down from somewhere up on the scaffolding.  It was cool, in an industrial sort of way.  As it turns out, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2007/11/18/small_fire_breaks_out_at_fenway/">also dangerous</a>.

I saw this news item on <a href="http://www.boston.com">Boston.com</a>.  I don't visit that site regularly, but I received a "Check out the new Boston.com" e-mail and figured I'd check out the new Boston.com.  The e-mail lists eight improvements they've made to the site.  The first is "Our pages are wider".  Having been involved with the design, development, and maintenance of <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">another complicated website</a>, I know how painful the seemingly-simple change of widening your site's standard width can be, but this feature is unlikely to impress a potential visitor.  I wouldn't lead with it.
