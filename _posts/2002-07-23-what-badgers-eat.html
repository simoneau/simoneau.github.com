<p>An e-mail arrived from Nabeel this morning:</p>
<p><i>I was watching a Simpson's rerun, the one where Homer divides the town because he doesn't like the new [area code] and 10 digit dialing.  At the beginning there's a tangent about a badger that's moved into the dog's house, and Lisa goes online to www.whatbadgerseat.com to find out what badgers eat in order to lure him out. [...] Anyway, I had my laptop running so I checked <a href="http://www.whatbadgerseat.com">www.whatbadgerseat.com</a>.  Sure enough, it's a real site.  It has the exact text that Lisa refers to.  In fact, it's owned by Fox.  I thought that was hysterical.  I wonder how many hits that gets...</i></p>
<p>Nice catch, Nabeel.  I also saw this rerun last night but never thought about trying it out.  Looking at <a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?advanced=1&amp;cat=web&amp;type=all&amp;q=link%3Awww.whatbadgerseat.com&amp;jsact=&amp;l=any&amp;ics=utf-8&amp;cs=utf-8&amp;wf%5Bn%5D=3&amp;wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=&amp;wf%5B0%5D%5Bq%5D=&amp;wf%5B0%5D%5Bw%5D=&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Bw%5D=&amp;wf%5B2%5D%5Br%5D=-&amp;wf%5B2%5D%5Bq%5D=&amp;wf%5B2%5D%5Bw%5D=&amp;dincl=&amp;dexcl=www.whatbadgerseat.com&amp;limip=&amp;age=&amp;size%5Bp%5D=%3D&amp;size%5Bv%5D=&amp;size%5Bx%5D=0&amp;hits=100&amp;nooc=off">all the sites that link to it</a>, Nabeel isn't the only one who noticed this.  It seems that Fox registered this domain name on <a href="http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?STRING=whatbadgerseat.com&amp;SearchType=do">09-Aug-2000</a>.  The original airdate for this episode wasn't until <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/episode_guide/1202.htm">05-Nov-2000</a>, three months later.</p>
