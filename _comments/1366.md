i met dita in sydney a couple of months ago. ice queen bitch . very unfriendly and totally self absorbed. quite attractive, alot of make up. i dont think she eats mutch, poor thing. she appears insecure, have you ever seen her smile, i spent four hours with her and her face did not crack from that mouth slightly open pose, marily would have got thoroughly bored with her i would think.
